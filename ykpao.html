                <h1>YK PAO SCHOOL</h1>
                <h3>Working with the <a href="http://www.ykpaoschool.cn/" target="_blank">YK Pao School</a> Foundation department, I designed the annual sponsorship booklet to introduce the school's education system and upcoming facilities as well as to allow the potential business partners growing interests about the sponsorship program. As a relevant marketing source, this project delivered not only important information to business clients and parents of future students but also exposed school's image to the public.</h3>

                <h2>gain the info</h2>
                <p>The first step to start the design process was to gather content from the Foundation department. The document was organized into different chapters which allowed me to examinate the amount of the texts and how to section them before working on the layout.</p>

                <p>â€‹To maintain the school's brand identity, I decided to adapt the brand color scheme that has been frequently applied to existing marketing materials. The green symbolizes growth and youth, yet the variety of tones implies the multi-dimensional principle that the school obtains in their education system.</p>

                <h2>further development</h2>
                <p>For content-heavy sections, the use of images would be minimal, but variation of type treatments helped to enhance hierarchy. For instance, The sections in which explained the instruction to apply for sponsorship were described in paragraphs and list forms. Hence, create a clean structure with various text styling indicated levels of hierarchy among the texts. Whereas sections showcasing the school's facilities focused more on imageries, therefore use of visual would be emphasized on those pages.</p>

                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>One significant challenge I found was the balance between text and imagery in limited space. The amount of texts was specified by the Foundation department and was expected to fit into certain sections. Similarly, some images were requested to be added with certain copy. Hence, I would need to brainstorm multiple possibilities on the layouts and sketched out various versions according to the length of content and number of the images needed to be included on the page. </p>
