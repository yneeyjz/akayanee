              <h1>FI.SPAN Corporate Website</h1>
              <h3>FI.SPAN is a fast-growing technology startup that provides a cloud-based API platform which enhances online banking experience among banks, their clients, and FinTech companies. One of the notable project I was working on was to redesign the company's corporate website to make it more modernized, user-friendly and professional.

      <h2>Issue</h2>
          <div class="row">

            <div class="col-lg-6">

              <p>To pain point the issues, I looked through the previous website and discussed with the Strategy Lead about what content to be included in order to plan out a strategic solution that enhanced navigation and refreshed the overall look of the website.</p>

              <p>The previous website appeared to be lack of hierarchy and consistency. There was no clear call-to-action to prompt the viewers taking on the desired actions. Some pages also contained heavy amount of content which seemed to be difficult to navigate through the information. Hence, my design consideration was to focus on the visual appeal as well as to restructure the layout of the content.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-6">
              <img src="img/fispan/2.jpg" alt="previous site">
            </div>
          </div>


          <div class="row">


            <div class="col-lg-12">
              <h2>Keep it consistent</h2>
              <p>To maintain the consistency, establish a style is crucial. After studying the brand elements of the company, I decided to keep the overall feel to be modern, consisting with majority of dark grey, white, and blue from the brand colour scheme. The addition of light blue brought in more dimensions without making the layout overwhelming and the orange created the contrast that played the role of call-to-action.</p>


              <img src="img/fispan/3.png" alt="fispan color">


            <p>I also created a set of icons and infographics which associated with the contents and enhanced visual communication.</p>

          </div>

          <h2>Put Everything Together</h2>
          <p>Before the actual implementation, I usually made rough sketched that allowed me to quickly drop down ideas. However, since the website would be made based on an existing template, there was limitation on the layout and spacing. And so, I made multiple versions so I could get a more accurate view and for the team to review.</p>
          <p><em>Multiple iterations for the home page</em></p>

              <img src="img/fispan/5.jpg" alt="draft1"></div>
              <div class="col-lg-6">
                <img src="img/fispan/6.jpg" alt="draft2"></div>
              </div>


              <p>To utilize the customization of the website, I worked on the styling by coding in CSS.</p>

              <img src="img/fispan/7.png" alt="fispan code interface">
                  <div class="placeholder"></div>

              <h2>Result</h2>
                <p>The new design has provided a refreshed impression on the brand while still maintaining the consideration of the existing brand language. The updated website has successfully reflecting the company's positioning as a dominant and innovated bank integration service provider. </p>
