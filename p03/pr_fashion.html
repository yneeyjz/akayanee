                <h1>PressReader for Fashion Week<br></h1>
                <h3>During Fall Fashion Week when all fashion lovers all came together, PressReader’s marketing team saw a great opportunity and partnered with publishers Hearst, Mondadori, and Condé Nast on a marketing campaign that offers one week of free access to the best Italian publications including Vogue, Elle, Grazia, Marie Claire, Vanity City, and Flair, along with over 6,000 other publications available on the platform.</h3>


                <h2>Social Media Campaign</h2>
                <p>While the campaign was extensive and involved with several designers to work together, my main role focused on social media including to implement eye-catching ads to attract frequent users on online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. As the target audience were enthusiasts who pay attention on the trend of fashion, I chose vivid colours and strong images to emphasize the chic and stylish appeal.</p>

                <p>​The image below features a girl wearing a pair of designer glasses and a hint of red lip colour. Additionally, The magazine reflection on the glasses shows what PressReader can offer.</p>

              <div class="col-lg-6 col-md-6 col-sm-6">
                <p>​​Whereas this one played with bold colours that reflect with the tone of the images, the geometric overlay adds more definition and a sense of edginess to the overall layout.</p>

                <p>​​Gif versions were also created since motion is able to make the content more dynamic and to grab attention easier. </p>

                <p>​​​The graphics were showcased in various online platforms. The campaign has received <strong>54,000</strong> impressions on Instagram alone and over <strong>2,500</strong> tweet engagements.  </p>

              <h2>Case study report</h2>
              <p>​Together the entire campaign has obtained <strong>1.3 million</strong> impression across digital platform and social media. After gaining such positive result from the promotion, the Marketing Manager assigned me to design a case study report, which collected all successful examples of the campaign and would be delivered to potential publishers and convince them to market their publications with PressReader.</p>

                        <div class="placeholder"></div>

              <p>​While the design for social media images could be wild and abstract, the report needed to maintain the brand identity as the piece was handled as the company's voice. Therefore, the design of the report followed the brand guideline, such as the colour green, the typeface, the signature bubble tail as for the header.</p>

              <p>​However, to incorporate with images and significant amount of text, I decided to use the 3-column grid in order to leave some white spaces for the images, making balance between the texts and visual elements. Also, to put the texts in column did not only make breaks between the paragraphs, but also mimic the layout of the magazine spreads. </p>

              <p>​For statistics, infographs would be a better and easy way to illustrate.</p>
